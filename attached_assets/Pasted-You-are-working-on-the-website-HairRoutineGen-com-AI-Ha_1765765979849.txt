You are working on the website HairRoutineGen.com (AI Hair Routine Generator).

TASK:
Fix and optimize the SEO meta title and meta description for the RESULT PAGE
(the page that shows the personalized hair routine after quiz completion).

CURRENT ISSUE:
The current meta title uses a conversational format like:
"Your Personalized Hair Routine for Straight, Low Porosity Hair"

This is NOT SEO-optimal.

GOAL:
Rewrite the meta title and meta description to follow Google SEO best practices:
- Keyword-first
- Short, clean, search-intent focused
- High CTR
- Safe length (no truncation)
- Unique per result page

---------------------------------
META TITLE RULE (VERY IMPORTANT):

Use this EXACT format:
"{Hair Type} Hair Routine – {Porosity} Care Plan"

Examples:
- "Straight Hair Routine – Low Porosity Care Plan"
- "Curly Hair Routine – High Porosity Care Plan"
- "Wavy Hair Routine – Medium Porosity Care Plan"

Constraints:
- Max length: 60 characters
- No words like "Your", "My", "Best", or emojis
- Capitalize each main word

---------------------------------
META DESCRIPTION RULE:

Generate a dynamic meta description using this template:

"Get a personalized daily and weekly hair routine for {Hair Type} hair with {Porosity} porosity. Includes step-by-step care and product tips."

Constraints:
- Length between 145–155 characters
- Must include:
  - hair type
  - porosity
  - routine
- Natural, readable English
- No keyword stuffing

---------------------------------
IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

- Hair Type and Porosity values come from quiz results
- Meta tags must be dynamically generated per user result
- Each result page must output UNIQUE title & description
- Ensure meta tags are rendered server-side or at page load (SEO-visible)

---------------------------------
TECHNICAL OUTPUT REQUIRED:

1. Replace the existing meta title logic with the new format
2. Replace the existing meta description logic with the new template
3. Ensure no title exceeds 60 characters
4. Ensure no description exceeds 160 characters
5. If data is missing, fallback to:
   Title: "Hair Routine Generator – Personalized Care Plan"
   Description: "Generate a personalized hair routine based on your hair type, porosity, and care goals in seconds."

This change is critical for:
- Google ranking
- Indexation of result pages
- Adsense approval
- Higher click-through rate
