PROJECT: HairRoutineGen.com (Hair Routine Generator Tool)

TASK:
Standardize and permanently fix the META TITLE and META DESCRIPTION
for ALL hair routine RESULT PAGES generated after the quiz.

CURRENT CORRECT FORMAT (DO NOT CHANGE):
Example:
"Coily Hair Routine – Medium Porosity Care Plan"

----------------------------------------
META TITLE RULE (STRICT):

Use this EXACT format for all result pages:

"{Hair Type} Hair Routine – {Porosity} Care Plan"

Examples:
- Coily Hair Routine – Medium Porosity Care Plan
- Straight Hair Routine – Low Porosity Care Plan
- Curly Hair Routine – High Porosity Care Plan
- Wavy Hair Routine – Medium Porosity Care Plan

Rules:
- Keyword-first (Hair Type must be first)
- Use an EN DASH (–), not a hyphen
- Title case capitalization
- Max length: 60 characters
- No extra words (no "Your", "Best", "Personalized", emojis, or pipes)
- One unique title per result page

----------------------------------------
META DESCRIPTION RULE:

Generate a dynamic meta description using this template:

"Get a personalized daily and weekly hair routine for {Hair Type} hair with {Porosity} porosity. Includes step-by-step care and product tips."

Rules:
- Length: 145–155 characters
- Must include hair type + porosity naturally
- Clear, informational, Adsense-safe
- No keyword stuffing

----------------------------------------
IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

- Hair Type and Porosity values are sourced from quiz results
- Meta tags must be dynamically rendered per result page
- Each combination (hair type + porosity) must output UNIQUE meta tags
- Render meta tags server-side or on initial page load for SEO visibility

----------------------------------------
FALLBACK (If quiz data is missing):

Meta Title:
"Hair Routine Generator – Personalized Care Plan"

Meta Description:
"Generate a personalized hair routine based on your hair type, porosity, and care goals in seconds."

----------------------------------------
DO NOT:
- Do not auto-generate conversational titles
- Do not reuse homepage meta tags
- Do not exceed character limits
- Do not index pages with missing data

----------------------------------------
SEO PURPOSE:
This fix is critical for:
- Programmatic SEO
- Google indexing
- High CTR
- Adsense approval
- Long-term scaling of result pages
