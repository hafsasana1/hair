PROJECT: HairRoutineGen.com
STACK: React (Vite) + SSR meta rendering

OBJECTIVE:
Fix over-optimization issues, align homepage SEO with Google best practices,
and ensure full Adsense approval readiness while preserving strong rankings.

-------------------------------------
PART 1: META TAG FIXES (HOMEPAGE)

CURRENT ISSUES:
- Meta title is generic and not keyword-optimal
- Meta description is overly promotional
- Deprecated / unnecessary meta tags are present

-------------------------------------
REQUIRED CHANGES:

1. UPDATE META TITLE (Homepage ONLY)

REPLACE:
"AI Hair Routine Generator by Hair Type & Climate"

WITH:
"Hair Routine Generator – Personalized Care by Hair Type"

RULES:
- Max 60 characters
- Keyword-first
- Informational tone
- No hype words

-------------------------------------
2. UPDATE META DESCRIPTION

REPLACE existing meta description with:

"Generate a personalized hair routine based on your hair type, porosity, and local climate. Get daily and weekly hair care steps in minutes."

RULES:
- 145–155 characters
- Informational
- Adsense-safe
- No claims like “trusted by”, numbers, or hype

-------------------------------------
3. REMOVE OUTDATED META TAGS

REMOVE COMPLETELY:
- <meta name="keywords">
- <meta name="geo.region">
- <meta name="geo.placename">

REASON:
- Deprecated
- No SEO benefit
- Can trigger Adsense quality review flags

-------------------------------------
PART 2: ROBOTS & INDEXING (KEEP)

KEEP the following as-is:
- robots index, follow
- googlebot / bingbot directives
- canonical URL

-------------------------------------
PART 3: SCHEMA CLEANUP (CRITICAL)

CURRENT STATE:
Multiple application schemas are causing redundancy.

-------------------------------------
REQUIRED SCHEMA ACTIONS:

1. KEEP:
✔ WebSite
✔ Organization
✔ SoftwareApplication
✔ BreadcrumbList
✔ ItemList

2. REMOVE:
✖ WebApplication schema

REASON:
- This is a web tool, not a downloadable or installable app
- Avoid schema conflicts

-------------------------------------
PART 4: FAQ SCHEMA RULE

FAQ schema should exist ONLY if FAQ content is visible in HTML.

IMPLEMENT LOGIC:
- If homepage displays visible FAQ section → keep FAQPage schema
- If FAQs are NOT visible → remove FAQPage schema from homepage
- FAQ schema will be re-added on:
  ✔ Result pages
  ✔ Dedicated FAQ page

-------------------------------------
PART 5: SPEAKABLE SCHEMA (OPTIONAL)

Speakable schema may remain, but:
- Do NOT rely on it for ranking
- Keep only if referenced content exists in HTML

-------------------------------------
PART 6: SSR REQUIREMENT (VERY IMPORTANT)

Ensure the following are SERVER-SIDE RENDERED or injected before hydration:

✔ <title>
✔ meta description
✔ canonical
✔ H1 heading
✔ short intro paragraph (above the fold)

REASON:
- Prevent empty HTML during Google crawl
- Improve indexing speed
- Improve ranking stability

-------------------------------------
PART 7: FINAL QUALITY CHECK

AFTER IMPLEMENTATION:
- No meta title > 60 characters
- No meta description > 160 characters
- No duplicate schema types
- Homepage remains globally targeted (not US-only)
- Page remains Adsense-compliant and informational

-------------------------------------
END GOAL:
A clean, authoritative, SEO-safe homepage that:
✔ Ranks easily
✔ Passes Adsense review
✔ Supports programmatic SEO growth
✔ Is future-proof for Google updates
